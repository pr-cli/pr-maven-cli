# Contributing to PR Maven CLI

Thank you for considering a contribution.

PR Maven CLI is intentionally designed as a contributor-friendly OSS project. The roadmap is split into focused issues so humans and automated coding agents can make useful progress without needing deep project context.

## Baseline

- Language: Go.
- Runtime dependencies: none for the stage 1 core.
- Target Maven baseline: Maven 3.9.x, documented against Maven 3.9.16.
- Maven 4 support is planned after the Maven 4 line is production-ready.
- License: Apache-2.0.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr-cli/pr-maven-cli.git
cd pr-maven-cli
go test ./...
```

Run the demo:

```bash
go run ./cmd/prmaven fails -project demo/multi-module-failure
go run ./cmd/prmaven why -project demo/multi-module-failure -format json
```

The demo includes versioned Maven report fixtures under `demo/multi-module-failure/**/target/*-reports`.

For the full test strategy, including golden files, CLI end-to-end tests, race tests, and CI behavior, read [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

For the GitHub pipeline, release flow, and branch protection recommendation, read [docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md) and [docs/release.md](docs/release.md).

For issue and pull request taxonomy, read [docs/labels.md](docs/labels.md). For maintainer-facing labeling workflow and scoped issue examples, read [docs/maintainer-labeling.md](docs/maintainer-labeling.md). Every planned issue and pull request should be labeled so contributors can understand type, area, stage, and readiness.

Every new issue and pull request receives the standard contributor thank-you message from [.github/contributor-thanks.md](.github/contributor-thanks.md). The automation lives in `.github/workflows/thank-contributor.yml`.

## Contribution Rules

- Keep PRs focused.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Preserve stable JSON fields unless the issue explicitly allows a breaking change.
- Prefer deterministic parsing over guessing.
- Keep network access optional.
- Do not add telemetry.
- Do not require external services for core tests.
- Do not commit generated binaries, local caches, or private CI logs.
- Keep branch names, pull request titles, commit messages, and merge messages focused on the product change. Do not include coding agent or tool names such as `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `aider`, or `devin`.

## Good First Contributions

Good first issues usually fit one of these areas:

- Add a parser fixture for a Maven plugin report.
- Improve output wording.
- Add edge-case coverage for Maven module discovery.
- Add documentation examples.
- Add one JSON field with a clear acceptance test.
- Improve error messages.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] The PR solves one issue or one clearly scoped problem.
- [ ] `go test ./...` passes.
- [ ] Golden files are updated when human-readable output intentionally changes.
- [ ] New behavior is covered by tests or fixtures.
- [ ] Documentation is updated when user-facing behavior changes.
- [ ] JSON output compatibility is preserved or the breaking change is explicitly justified.

## Automated Contributions

Automated coding agents are welcome when the contribution is reviewable.

Expected standard:

- The PR title references the issue.
- The PR body explains the change in plain language.
- Tests are included.
- The diff is scoped.
- The contribution does not perform unrelated refactors.
- Public metadata describes the product change, not the automation used to produce it.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are expected to:

- Keep issues small and actionable.
- Add acceptance criteria to issues.
- Label issues consistently.
- Review contributor PRs with clear, respectful feedback.
- Favor production reliability over feature volume.
